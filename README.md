# HPC_Assignment

CSC4028Z High performance computing main assignment

weak scaling and strong scaling - in notes
will probably not have strong scaling but will have weak scaling

speed up for each graph - weak scaling

overhead costs for each graph - strong scaling

- serial and openMP should be the some - MPI vs openMP overhead costs
